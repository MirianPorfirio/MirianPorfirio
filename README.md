# Hello, I'm Mirian Porfirioüë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª
```
üìù From a young age, I've always been captivated by the world of technology,
with a particular fascination for the realm of Front-end development.
The art of crafting user experiences through code has been a
driving force in my journey. As I delved deeper into my passion,
I seized the opportunity to take my first steps into the realms of
UX Design and Mobile Flutter. These studies have opened up a new
realm of possibilities, allowing me to merge my creative instincts
with the technical skills needed to shape innovative and user-friendly
mobile experiences. With each line of code,
I am shaping my aspirations into reality, and
I'm excited to continue this ever-evolving exploration
at the intersection of technology and design.
